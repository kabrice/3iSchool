During the last few weeks, we’ve had multiple conversations on the program requirements and what we can do to better reflect what’s most important to our community. We believe that average live viewers per broadcasts meet that requirement. The live interactions and audiences you’ve brought together on Periscope are at the heart of what we do, and we will be focusing on those metrics to review applications.

Lately, I’ve been drinking very tasty wines from the Etna D.O.C. growing region in Sicily, which is known for producing earthy, minerally and balanced red wines at a great value — especially over the past three years.

We’re blown away by the number of people who’ve applied, the thoughtfulness of everyone’s applications and the feedback shared on the program itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Many of you shared with us that “number of followers” is not always the best indication of live content, and we agree. During the last few weeks, we’ve had multiple conversations on the program requirements and what we can do to better reflect what’s most important to our community. We believe that average live viewers per broadcasts meet that requirement. The live interactions and audiences you’ve brought together on Periscope are at the heart of what we do, and we will be focusing on those metrics to review applications. Follower count has been totally removed from the requirements.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The updated live viewer requirements for each level are:</p>21.",

If you don’t enjoy life because you’re stuck with a permanent illness that prevents you from doing what you enjoy and find fulfilling - that is, what gives your life meaning - then it might be rational to take your own life.

Google Home is a voice-activated speaker, powered by the Google Assistant. You say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” and your question is sent to askjelly.com — powered by helpful people who enjoy answering in topics of interest. Jelly has a different voice than the Google Assistant, so you know it’s Jelly.</p><p name='54ca' id='54ca' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>Why ask Jelly questions when you have all of Google sitting on your kitchen counter? Good question! When we partnered with the Google Assistant for this integration, we knew for many questions there isn’t a fact-based answer. Maybe the Internet doesn’t know — you need an opinion, you’re not sure how to ask, it’s subjective, or it’s a personal question.</p><p name='1171' id='1171' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>When I first tried Google Home, I was smitten. Not like Joaquin Phoenix in HER.

Timing is everything. It reminded me of Twitter’s early days and the smartphone emerged. A game changer.</p><p name='5d94' id='5d94' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>For a while, we’ve been working on an alternative search engine that doesn’t spit out lots of links, it provides answers from helpful people. Have a question, get helpful answers. Boom. Done. When you say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” it goes through the Jelly answer engine and back. Et Voila! Jelly helps make the Google Assistant on Google Home more helpful.</p><p name='941b' id='941b' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last'><em class='markup--em markup--p-em'>Biz Stone,<br>Co-founder and CEO<br>Jelly Industries, Inc.</em></p>14.",

If you don’t enjoy life because of a temporary situation or a situation that is reversible, like a temporary but painful illness, then it’s not strictly better (again, though, we haven’t exactly defined what “better” means) since the potential exists for you to regain your previous independence and continue doing what you love to do. If you don’t enjoy life because you’re stuck with a permanent illness that prevents you from doing what you enjoy and find fulfilling - that is, what gives your life meaning - then it might be rational to take your own life. But again, is it “better”? That’s unclear simply because I’m not sure how you’re defining “better”. And definitions matter when we’re talking about comparisons like this - what is the metric you are using to judge life, for example?</p>2.",
                    "importance": "<p class='qtext_para'>The purpose of life is to survive and procreate. To aid in this purpose, we have evolved rewards for pursuing these two ends, for example the joy from eating delicious foods and orgasms from having sex. The act of being alive itself is a revolutionary one since there are so many forces arrayed against it. Learning to celebrate that and the simple joys of seeing, hearing, living among other living things, gives one joy.</p><p class='qtext_para'>Yet, some people are in the throes of extreme suffering and pain. For them, the continuance of life must give them pause as it does Hamlet: “to be or not to be.” I myself have been in medical crises when I begged for life to end rather than continue to suffer.

If you don’t enjoy life because of a temporary situation or a situation that is reversible, like a temporary but painful illness, then it’s not strictly better (again, though, we haven’t exactly defined what “better” means) since the potential exists for you to regain your previous independence and continue doing what you love to do. If you don’t enjoy life because you’re stuck with a permanent illness that prevents you from doing what you enjoy and find fulfilling - that is, what gives your life meaning - then it might be rational to take your own life. But again, is it “better”? That’s unclear simply because I’m not sure how you’re defining “better”.

If you don’t enjoy life because of a temporary situation or a situation that is reversible, like a temporary but painful illness, then it’s not strictly better (again, though, we haven’t exactly defined what “better” means) since the potential exists for you to regain your previous independence and continue doing what you love to do. If you don’t enjoy life because you’re stuck with a permanent illness that prevents you from doing what you enjoy and find fulfilling - that is, what gives your life meaning - then it might be rational to take your own life. But again, is it “better”? That’s unclear simply because I’m not sure how you’re defining “better”.

Google Home is a voice-activated speaker, powered by the Google Assistant. You say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” and your question is sent to askjelly.com — powered by helpful people who enjoy answering in topics of interest. Jelly has a different voice than the Google Assistant, so you know it’s Jelly.</p><p name='54ca' id='54ca' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>Why ask Jelly questions when you have all of Google sitting on your kitchen counter? Good question! When we partnered with the Google Assistant for this integration, we knew for many questions there isn’t a fact-based answer. Maybe the Internet doesn’t know — you need an opinion, you’re not sure how to ask, it’s subjective, or it’s a personal question.</p><p name='1171' id='1171' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>When I first tried Google Home, I was smitten. Not like Joaquin Phoenix in HER. More like, “Holy moly, voice is going to be a paradigm shift in personal computing.” We had recently launched <a href='http://askjelly.com' data-href='http://askjelly.com' class='markup--anchor markup--p-anchor' target='_blank'>askjelly.com</a> — a way to get short, concise answers from helpful people. Timing is everything. It reminded me of Twitter’s early days and the smartphone emerged. A game changer.</p><p name='5d94' id='5d94' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>For a while, we’ve been working on an alternative search engine that doesn’t spit out lots of links, it provides answers from helpful people. Have a question, get helpful answers. Boom. Done. When you say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” it goes through the Jelly answer engine and back. Et Voila! Jelly helps make the Google Assistant on Google Home more helpful.</p><p name='941b' id='941b' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last'><em class='markup--em markup--p-em'>Biz Stone,<br>Co-founder and CEO<br>Jelly Industries, Inc.</em></p>14.",

Whether you’re eating salmon, pork tenderloin or pasta with a red sauce, these wines are perfect for date night.</p>19.",

Google Home is a voice-activated speaker, powered by the Google Assistant.

Good question! When we partnered with the Google Assistant for this integration, we knew for many questions there isn’t a fact-based answer. Maybe the Internet doesn’t know — you need an opinion, you’re not sure how to ask, it’s subjective, or it’s a personal question.</p><p name='1171' id='1171' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>When I first tried Google Home, I was smitten.

Of course, you are free to disagree with this. Yet your claim that this is “certainly” the case seems to me to be unsubstantiated.

They may differ in orthodoxy, but their claims about [ortho]praxis are strikingly similar.</p><p class='qtext_para'>Perhaps your Rule #5 is meant to address this.

If you don’t enjoy life because you’re stuck with a permanent illness that prevents you from doing what you enjoy and find fulfilling - that is, what gives your life meaning - then it might be rational to take your own life.

Of course, you are free to disagree with this. Yet your claim that this is “certainly” the case seems to me to be unsubstantiated. For millennia, the world’s major religious traditions have been in fundamental agreement on the core tenets of human behavior. They may differ in orthodoxy, but their claims about [ortho]praxis are strikingly similar.</p>\r\n<p class='qtext_para'>Perhaps your Rule #5 is meant to address this. Yet economics, political science and psychology all tell us that millions of people act differently than pure reason would indicate.

During the last few weeks, we’ve had multiple conversations on the program requirements and what we can do to better reflect what’s most important to our community. We believe that average live viewers per broadcasts meet that requirement. The live interactions and audiences you’ve brought together on Periscope are at the heart of what we do, and we will be focusing on those metrics to review applications.

Lately, I’ve been drinking very tasty wines from the Etna D.O.C. growing region in Sicily, which is known for producing earthy, minerally and balanced red wines at a great value — especially over the past three years.

Whether you’re eating salmon, pork tenderloin or pasta with a red sauce, these wines are perfect for date night.</p>9.",

Google Home is a voice-activated speaker, powered by the Google Assistant. You say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” and your question is sent to askjelly.com — powered by helpful people who enjoy answering in topics of interest. Jelly has a different voice than the Google Assistant, so you know it’s Jelly.</p><p name='54ca' id='54ca' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>Why ask Jelly questions when you have all of Google sitting on your kitchen counter? Good question! When we partnered with the Google Assistant for this integration, we knew for many questions there isn’t a fact-based answer. Maybe the Internet doesn’t know — you need an opinion, you’re not sure how to ask, it’s subjective, or it’s a personal question.</p><p name='1171' id='1171' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>When I first tried Google Home, I was smitten. Not like Joaquin Phoenix in HER. More like, “Holy moly, voice is going to be a paradigm shift in personal computing.” We had recently launched <a href='http://askjelly.com' data-href='http://askjelly.com' class='markup--anchor markup--p-anchor' target='_blank'>askjelly.com</a> — a way to get short, concise answers from helpful people. Timing is everything. It reminded me of Twitter’s early days and the smartphone emerged. A game changer.</p><p name='5d94' id='5d94' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>For a while, we’ve been working on an alternative search engine that doesn’t spit out lots of links, it provides answers from helpful people. Have a question, get helpful answers. Boom. Done. When you say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” it goes through the Jelly answer engine and back. Et Voila! Jelly helps make the Google Assistant on Google Home more helpful.</p><p name='941b' id='941b' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last'><em class='markup--em markup--p-em'>Biz Stone,<br>Co-founder and CEO<br>Jelly Industries, Inc.</em></p>15.",

Lately, I’ve been drinking very tasty wines from the Etna D.O.C. growing region in Sicily, which is known for producing earthy, minerally and balanced red wines at a great value — especially over the past three years.

Google Home is a voice-activated speaker, powered by the Google Assistant. You say, “Ok Google, ask Jelly…” and your question is sent to askjelly.com — powered by helpful people who enjoy answering in topics of interest. Jelly has a different voice than the Google Assistant, so you know it’s Jelly.</p><p name='54ca' id='54ca' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>Why ask Jelly questions when you have all of Google sitting on your kitchen counter? Good question! When we partnered with the Google Assistant for this integration, we knew for many questions there isn’t a fact-based answer. Maybe the Internet doesn’t know — you need an opinion, you’re not sure how to ask, it’s subjective, or it’s a personal question.</p><p name='1171' id='1171' class='graf graf--p graf-after--p'>When I first tried Google Home, I was smitten.

The live interactions and audiences you’ve brought together on Periscope are at the heart of what we do, and we will be focusing on those metrics to review applications. Follower count has been totally removed from the requirements.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The updated live viewer requirements for each level are:</p>28.",

If you don’t enjoy life because of a temporary situation or a situation that is reversible, like a temporary but painful illness, then it’s not strictly better (again, though, we haven’t exactly defined what “better” means) since the potential exists for you to regain your previous independence and continue doing what you love to do. If you don’t enjoy life because you’re stuck with a permanent illness that prevents you from doing what you enjoy and find fulfilling - that is, what gives your life meaning - then it might be rational to take your own life. But again, is it “better”? That’s unclear simply because I’m not sure how you’re defining “better”. And definitions matter when we’re talking about comparisons like this - what is the metric you are using to judge life, for example?</p>2.",

To aid in this purpose, we have evolved rewards for pursuing these two ends, for example the joy from eating delicious foods and orgasms from having sex. The act of being alive itself is a revolutionary one since there are so many forces arrayed against it. Learning to celebrate that and the simple joys of seeing, hearing, living among other living things, gives one joy.</p><p class='qtext_para'>Yet, some people are in the throes of extreme suffering and pain. For them, the continuance of life must give them pause as it does Hamlet: “to be or not to be.” I myself have been in medical crises when I begged for life to end rather than continue to suffer. But it didn’t and I didn’t.</p><p class='qtext_para'>Humans are special in that their impact is such that they may bring the earth to the point where it cannot continue to sustain life including their own.
